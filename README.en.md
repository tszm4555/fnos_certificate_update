# Feiniu OS Certificate Update and Service Restart Script

[中文版本](README.md)

> **Please execute with root privileges**  
> **Please resolve network issues on your own**

This is a Bash script designed specifically for the Feiniu OS system, used to automatically update SSL/TLS certificates. The script utilizes the acme.sh tool for certificate renewal and uses Alibaba Cloud DNS for domain verification to ensure the certificate is updated before it expires. After updating, the script will back up the old certificate, replace it with the new one, and automatically restart related services to ensure the new certificate takes effect.

## Features

- **Certificate Renewal**: Automatically checks the SSL certificate's validity period and renews it when less than 7 days remain.
- **Backup and Replacement**: Backs up the old certificate before updating and replaces it with the new one after renewal.
- **Service Restart**: Automatically restarts specified services (such as `webdav.service`, `smbftpd.service`, `trim_nginx.service`) after the certificate is updated to ensure the new certificate is applied.
- **Alibaba Cloud API Integration**: Uses Alibaba Cloud API keys for DNS domain validation, ensuring a smooth certificate renewal process.
- **Feiniu OS Specific**: Designed for certificate management in Feiniu OS, adapted to its directory structure and service management.

## System Requirements

- Feiniu OS system environment
- Bash Shell
- Alibaba Cloud API access with DNS management permissions
- Root privileges to perform service restarts and certificate file operations

## Configuration File Description

The script requires a YAML configuration file (`update_cert.yaml`) with the following format:

```yaml
# Certificate name, typically the domain or service name you choose for the certificate.
# Example: "baidu.com"
cert_name: "example.com"

# The directory where the certificate and key files will be saved.
# Example: "./cert" or "/path/to/cert"
cert_path: "/path/to/cert"

# The directory to store backups of the old certificate before updating.
# The old certificate will be moved to this directory for future restoration or inspection.
# Example: "./backup" or "/path/to/backup"
backup_dir: "/path/to/backup"

# Email address used for certificate issuance and renewal notifications.
# This email will receive important messages about certificate expiration and updates.
# Example: "user@example.com"
email: "user@example.com"

# Alibaba Cloud API key for DNS domain verification.
# You need to obtain this API key from the Alibaba Cloud console.
# Example: "your_aliyun_api_key"
Ali_Key: "your_aliyun_api_key"

# The Secret for the Alibaba Cloud API key, used together with the API key.
# Example: "your_aliyun_api_secret"
Ali_Secret: "your_aliyun_api_secret"

# Feiniu OS certificate location: After uploading the certificate, use this command to find it:  
# cat /usr/trim/etc/network_cert_all.conf
# This path points to your currently used certificate file, which the script will check to determine if an update is needed.
# Example: "/path/to/old/certificate.crt"
old_crt: "/path/to/old/certificate.crt"
old_key: "/path/to/old/private.key"

# List of domains for which the certificate should be issued.
# These domains will be used for domain ownership verification and certificate generation.
# Note: At least one domain must be included.
# Example:
# domains:
#   - "example.com"
#   - "*.example.com"   # * represents a wildcard domain, verifying all second-level domains under this domain
domains:
  - "example.com"
  - "*.example.com"
